## Next Step
- Make "add" work > functions.go, 145-171

## Required Additions: Todos
- make add actually add to the json file
  - Take user input and add it to a json schema, which can then be added to the existing list
- update state file for both add and see
  - Check whether user input is existing file, else ask whether to create or not?
  - Maybe show list of all existing files
    - If user still misstypes > ask whether he want to create, or try again
- <s> see > read json and print out properly </s>
- add mark/delete once task is done
  - both for tasks and entire lists
  - tasks have identifier at beginning of line > use that

## Featurues for later
- show all available lists when choosing which one to see/add to?
